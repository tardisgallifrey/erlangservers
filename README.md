# Learning Erlang Servers

I am learning Erlang Server programming.  As such, I have three servers called, Tom, Dick, and Harry.  These allow sending messages back and forth.  This first version is pretty pathetic, but I will build on it in future branches.

1. main branch is the first one I wrote that functions.
2. v2 is a branch with tom.erl heavily commented.
