# Learning Erlang Servers

I am learning Erlang Server programming.  As such, I have three servers called, Tom, Dick, and Harry.  These allow sending messages back and forth.  This first version is pretty pathetic, but I will build on it in future branches.

### This repo will maintain branch integrity

In order to show the path of development on this little project, I will not be merging any commits from branches.  Each branch will stand alone.

1. main branch -- original as written (pedantic, yes).
2. v2 -- same as main, but tom.erl is heavily commented.
3. v3 -- Most comments removed, next steps done.
