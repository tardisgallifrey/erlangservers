# Learning Erlang Servers

I am learning Erlang Server programming.  As such, I have three servers called, Tom, Dick, and Harry.  These allow sending messages back and forth.  This first version is pretty pathetic, but I will build on it in future branches.

### This repo will maintain branch integrity

In order to show the path of development on this little project, I will not be merging any commits from branches.  Each branch will stand alone.

1. main branch -- original as written (pedantic, yes).
2. v2 -- same as main, but tom.erl is heavily commented.
3. v3 -- Most comments removed, Added simple `send/1` function to send by atom name of server.
4. v4 -- Changed `send/1` to a generic send message to server name with checks.
5. v5 -- Created a single tom server based on OTP gen_server.
=======
1. main branch is the first one I wrote that functions.
2. v2 is a branch with tom.erl heavily commented.
3. v3 is a branch with checks to see if server is running.
4. v4 is a branch that has a generic `send/1` with server checks.
5. v5 is a basic OTP gen_server that only talks to itself.
6. v6 is OTP gen_server with non-OTP client
7. v7 is OTP gen_server with non-OTP client and DETS (message saving).
8. v8 is OTP gen_server with DETS and supervisor.
9. v9 turns our server generic and allows us to call person_server with a server name.
10. v10 adds Erlan OTP app folder structure and moves to dynamic supervision.
