These are REPL commands that can be used to test application, supervisor, and server operations.

Simple:
whereis(serverName) -- reports PID and status of individual gen_server

Supervisor:
whereis(supervisorName) -- same as for server
supervisor:which_children(supervisorName) -- should list status of servers running.

Application:
application:which_applications() -- should list status of applications running (will show stdlib and kernel regardless).

Kill commands:
exit(whereis(serverName), kill) -- kill server
exit(whereis(supervisorName), kill) -- kill supervisor.
